## Usage

To add forms to other entities, simply use `\Rinvex\Forms\Traits\HasForms` trait in the model. Example: you may have `Event` model, that requires registration form, then confirmation form, and every form fields differs from an event to another, in this case you can attach `From` models to your `Event` models using that trait.

To add form responses to users, simply use `\Rinvex\Forms\Traits\HasFormResponses` trait in the model. Example: you most probably will allow your users to fill forms while signed in, in such case you need to attach their responses to their accounts for later retrieval, and you can do so using that trait. This will attach `FormResponse` models to your user models `User`.

### Manage your forms

```php
// Get instance of your parent model (ex. `Event`)
$event = new \App\Models\Event::find(1);

// Create multiple new forms
$event->forms()->createMany([
    [...],
    [...],
    [...],
]);

// Find an existing form
$form = app('rinvex.forms.form')->find(1);

// Update an existing form
$form->update([
    'name' => 'Contact Us',
]);

// Delete form
$form->delete();

// Alternative way of form deletion
$event->forms()->where('id', 123)->first()->delete();

// Get attached forms collection
$event->forms;

// Get attached forms query builder
$event->forms();
```
